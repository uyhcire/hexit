A simple AlphaGo-like AI for 5x5 [Hex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)).

Inspired by [Thinking Fast and Slow with Deep Learning and Tree Search](https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/1705.08439/)

To play, run `go run src/cmd/play.go`. The AI plays almost randomly at the moment, but if it can win in a single move it will.
